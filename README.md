# rook-vs-bishop
Repository for the Zus Health take-home Rook vs. Bishop assignment

# Conda Enviroment
Created an Anaconda enviroment for rook-vs-bishop

```
conda create --name rook-vs-bishop
```

Under the understanding that no extraneous packages need to be installed, will be continuing with the code

# Design Process (Notes)
An object-oriented approach was taken to designing the pieces, board, game, then main function to run everything

Noted from the diagram that the Rook is black and the Bishop is white

Created a custom UI to represent the pieces on the board, displaying the Rook and Bishop with color as well as the board

Utilized custom classes to print color
